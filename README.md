I am an ISTQB Certified Tester with 7 years of experience as a Software Test Automation Engineer, dedicated to ensuring software quality and functionality. I am skilled in Java/Kotlin programming, Android SDK, Espresso, Appium, Selenium, Gitlab-CI, Jenkins, Docker, Postman, Rest Assured, SQL, and other software development and testing tools. I have experience mentoring and training interns, and delivering workshops. I am eager to continue developing my expertise in test automation and expanding my technical skills in Quality Assurance.


#### WORK EXPERIENCE
**REWE International – IT Development Expert, Vienna (_December 2022 — present_)**
<br> As an Expert Software Developer in Automation, I built a native Android UI test framework for two Android applications: a 10-flavor White Label Solution app (Billa + Penny) with a reusable screen/Semantics DSL, and the Jö Bonus Club app. I designed and set up parameterized GitLab CI and Docker pipelines, introducing variables for test suite selection (Smoke, Sanity, Regression), feature targeting, emulator count, and retry limits to handle flaky tests. I enabled parallel execution on two emulators and implemented a horizontally scalable approach to add more devices when needed, including standardized AVD provisioning and automated artifact publishing (logs, screenshots, videos, and Allure reports). In parallel, I expanded mobile UI coverage with Appium alongside the native E2E/UI testing frameworks, and I also write backend REST API tests. Additionally, I author documentation and onboarding guides, and define coding standards to ensure consistency across the test automation codebase.

**Software Developer Engineer in Test at Zattoo GmbH, Berlin (_March 2022 — October 2024_)**
<br> As the sole Software Developer Engineer in Test at Zattoo GmbH, I have been responsible
for designing and implementing the automated test infrastructure from scratch for
the Android application for both Android TV and mobile devices. I implemented an
environment for running both online and offline UI tests, locally and on CI. I mentored
and successfully trained the entire development team in test automation practices,
developed various types of technical documentation including an internal automation
convention, participated in static testing, reported bugs and assisted with manual
testing.

**Senior Automation Android QA Engineer at EPAM Systems, Odessa (_November 2021 — February 2022_)**
 <br> Automated UI tests for an Android application of a Canadian retail company. Conducted
code reviews for pull requests with automated tests. Due to an emergency situation in
my country, I was forced to leave the company.

**QA Automation Engineer at Andersen Lab, Odessa (_July 2017 — November 2021_)**
- **Big TV Streaming Project (October 2018 – October 2021):** Enhanced offline tests by adding online test capabilities. Designed and implemented 230 UI tests. Established a CI process environment for UI tests with parallel execution on 15 AVD using Docker, GitLab-CI, and a special test runner. Optimized the regression testing process, reducing execution time from 90 minutes to 13 minutes, which increased productivity by 85.56%, accelerating the execution of 300 tests by approximately 7 times. Designed test cases for automation, trained
and mentored 3 manual testers in automation practices, participated in static and
manual testing.
- **Internet Banking Project (November 2017 – October 2018):** Automated UI testing.
Maintained auto-test relevance, reported bugs. Collaborated with the development
team to effectively solve issues.
- **Car Rent Mobile Project (July 2017 – November 2017):** Conducted manual functional, GUI, smoke, regression, and mobile testing. Performed bug reporting and defects validation. Used various test design techniques to write and execute test cases.

**UniCredit Bank and others, Odessa (_August 2004 — May 2014_)**
Before my tech career, I worked in the banking system. I started my professional path as
a certified property appraiser and advanced to the position of Bank Branch Manager of
Unicredit Bank in Odessa. During this period, I gained extensive experience in interacting
and communicating with Clients and Teammates.
