I am an ISTQB Certified Tester with 8 years of experience as a Software Test Automation Engineer, dedicated to ensuring software quality and functionality. I am skilled in Java/Kotlin programming, Swift, Android SDK, Espresso, XCTest, Appium, Gitlab-CI, Jenkins, Docker, Postman, Rest Assured, SQL, and other software development and testing tools. I have experience mentoring and training interns, and delivering workshops. I am eager to continue developing my expertise in test automation and expanding my technical skills in Quality Assurance.


#### WORK EXPERIENCE
**REWE International – IT Development Expert, Vienna (_December 2024 — present_)**
<br> As an expert in test automation software development, I built from scratch a native end-to-end testing framework for the Android Penny and Billa apps across 10 markets, as well as for the Jö Bonus Club app. I also created and maintained a native iOS test automation framework for the Billa and Penny apps. I designed and implemented a parameterized GitLab CI pipeline running on Docker, enabling flexible execution by test suite (Smoke/Sanity/Regression), targeted checks, emulator count for parallel runs, and reruns. I introduced retries and stabilization measures and maintain a near-zero flaky-failure rate: regular runs over the past several months have shown zero failed tests. I also set up reporting and automated post-run artifact publishing (logs, screenshots, videos, reports) to Microsoft Teams. In parallel, I expanded UI test coverage with Appium, wrote backend REST API tests, and performed manual testing. Additionally, I created guides, internal guidelines, and a QA strategy for mobile products.

**Software Developer Engineer in Test at Zattoo GmbH, Berlin (_March 2022 — October 2024_)**
<br> As the sole Software Developer Engineer in Test at Zattoo GmbH, I designed and implemented the automated test infrastructure from scratch for the Android application across both Android TV and mobile devices. I built an environment for running online and offline UI tests both locally and in CI. I mentored and successfully trained the development team in test automation practices, created technical documentation including an internal automation convention, participated in static testing, reported bugs, and supported manual testing.

**Senior Automation Android QA Engineer at EPAM Systems, Odessa (_November 2021 — February 2022_)**
 <br> I automated UI tests for an Android application for a Canadian retail company and conducted code reviews for pull requests related to test automation. Due to an emergency situation in my country, I was forced to leave the company.

**QA Automation Engineer at Andersen Lab, Odessa (_July 2017 — November 2021_)**
- **Big TV Streaming Project (October 2018 – October 2021):** Enhanced existing offline tests by adding online coverage. Designed and implemented 230 UI tests. Set up a CI environment for UI tests with parallel execution on 15 AVDs using Docker, GitLab CI, and a custom test runner. Optimized regression testing from 90 minutes to 13 minutes, increasing productivity by 85.56% and accelerating execution of 300 tests by approximately 7x. Designed test cases for automation, trained and mentored three manual testers in automation practices, and participated in static and manual testing.
- **Internet Banking Project (November 2017 – October 2018):** Automated UI testing, maintained the relevance of automated tests, and reported bugs. Collaborated with the development team to resolve issues effectively.
- **Car Rent Mobile Project (July 2017 – November 2017):** Conducted manual functional, GUI, smoke, regression, and mobile testing. Performed bug reporting and defects validation. Used various test design techniques to write and execute test cases.

**UniCredit Bank and others, Odessa (_August 2004 — May 2014_)**
Before transitioning to tech, I worked in the banking sector. I started my professional path as a certified property appraiser and advanced to the position of Branch Manager at UniCredit Bank in Odessa. During this period, I gained extensive experience in client and team communication.
